# CS-340 Dashboard Project

As a computer programmer, I prioritize ensuring that my code is easy to understand, use, and maintain. I achieve this by using descriptive names and thorough comments. When starting a project, I first determine the client's needs and then design a solution to meet those needs. For example, I created a dashboard for a Dash project to assist rescue dog trainers in finding the right dogs for their work, making their jobs easier and potentially saving more lives.

In general, I believe that computer scientists like myself can make a significant impact by leveraging technology to solve problems. Creating user-friendly software can help people work more efficiently and effectively.
