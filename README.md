# CS-340 Dashboard Project

As someone who writes computer programs, I focus on making sure that my code is easy to understand, use, and change. For example, in one project, I made a part of the code that deals with storing information into a database reusable, so that I could use it again in other projects. I also made sure that the code was easy to read by using descriptive names for things, leaving comments to explain what the code does, and following some basic rules that other programmers use to make their code easy to understand.

In my dash project, I used that same code to make a dashboard that shows some information from the database. This made the code easier to write and understand because I didn't have to worry about how the database works. It also meant that I could use the code again in other projects without having to write everything from scratch.

When I'm working on a project, I start by figuring out what the client needs and how I can best help them. I then design a solution and make sure that it works well. For project two, I made a dashboard that helps people who train rescue dogs to find the right dogs for the job. By making this dashboard, I made it easier for the trainers to do their work, which could help save more lives.

Overall, I think that computer scientists like me can make a big difference by using technology to solve problems. By making software that's easy to use and understand, we can help people work more efficiently and effectively.
